        <h1>Code Flow</h1>
        <p>
            When the
            computer's execution gets to the end of the source you’ve given it, the program is done and the
            computer has completed running your code.
            It isn’t necessary for your code to be purely linear from the top of the file to the end of the file, however.
            You can instruct the computer to execute the same section of code multiple times -- this is called a
            program LOOP. Also, you can have the computer jump to a different section of your code, based on
            whether a certain condition is true or false -- this is called an IF-ELSE statement (or a conditional).
            Finally, for code that you expect to use often, whether called by various places in your own code, or
            perhaps even called by others’ code, you can separate this out and give it a specific label so that it can
            be called directly. This is called a FUNCTION.
