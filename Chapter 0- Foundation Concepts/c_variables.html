            <p>
                A variable is a specific spot in memory, with a label that you give it. You can put anything you want into
                that memory location and later refer to the value of that memory, by using the label. The statement:
                var myName = 'Martin';
                creates a variable, gives it a label of myName, and puts a value of ‘Martin’ into that memory location.
            </p>

                In most programming languages, you will see =​ as well as ==​. These mean two different things! The
                single-equals can be described as “Set the value of X equal to the value of Y”. The double-equals can
                be described as “Is the value of X equivalent to the value of Y?” In short, = ​sets things, and ==
                compares things
