        <h1>What is Source Code?</h1>
        <p> Languages all essentially do the same thing: they
            take a series of steps that a human has laid out to instruct the computer how to respond, and they
            translate those steps into a format that the computer can understand and can later execute.
            These series of steps, written in human-readable languages like PHP, are what we call Source
            CodE</p>
